## Requirements
- Git (any version will do)
- Node v11.14.0
  - I recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to handle Node versions.
  - If you have nvm install you can run `nvm use` to install the version required for Forium

## Installation
- Checkout repo (you're already there, good job!)
- Run `npm i` to install Node dependencies

## Running
- `npm build` builds the project
- `npm watch` runs development mode
